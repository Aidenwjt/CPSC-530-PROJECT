\section*{Quiz Questions and Answers}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[\textbf{Q1:}]
What specific type of Binary Tree is used in the implementation of the BCCBT Data Compression Algorithm?
Describe at least one discussed property of this type of Binary Tree.

\item[\textbf{A1:}]
The specific type of Binary Tree used is a \textbf{Complete Binary Tree}.
The relevant properties of this type of Binary Tree that will be discussed during our presentation are as follows.
\begin{itemize}
\item In a Complete Binary Tree all levels, EXCEPT potentially the last level, are completely full.
\item In a Complete Binary Tree nodes are filled in from left to right at each level.
\item In a Complete Binary Tree the number of nodes at level $n$ is $2^n$.
\end{itemize}

\item[\textbf{Q3:}]
Does the BCCBT algorithm make use of the frequency of each symbol, explain why.
\item[\textbf{A3:}]
Yes it does the reason why the BCCBT algorithm makes use of the frequency for each symbol is
because it has to have the frequencys for each symbol in order to make a frequency table which
is used in order to create the complete binary tree which is at the core of the algorithm.
