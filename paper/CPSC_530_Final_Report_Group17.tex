\section{Introduction}
Provides the context and motivates the topic. It introduces the paper/research that is the basis of the project. \cite{Sjostrand}


\section{Proposed Work}
Describes the proposed work and evaluation framework (e.g. experiments, data analysis, statistical tests, mathematical proof..).


\section{Evaluation}
Implementation and Experiments: what you actually did (objectives, choices, data, and final analysis of results).
Base comparison: (what is a comparable work, and relating your work to existing works).
Developed software and how it can be evaluated.


\section{Planning and Execution}
Compares the final work with the project proposal: comments on if the stated goals have been achieved, and if not, outlines the challenges.
Outlines contributions of group members including, ideas, implementation, research, writing report.
